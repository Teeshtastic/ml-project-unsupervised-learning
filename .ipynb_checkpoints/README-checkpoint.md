#Project Description:
In this project, we will apply unsupervised learning techniques to a real-world data set and use data visualization tools to communicate the insights gained from the analysis.
The data set for this project is the "Wholesale Data" dataset containing information about various products sold by a grocery store.
The project will involve the following tasks:

#Exploratory data analysis and pre-processing: We will import and clean the data sets, analyze and visualize the relationships between the different variables, handle missing values and outliers, and perform feature engineering as needed.
Unsupervised learning: We will use the Wholesale Data dataset to perform k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to identify patterns and group similar data points together. We will determine the optimal number of clusters and communicate the insights gained through data visualization.

The ultimate goal of the project is to gain insights from the data sets and communicate these insights to stakeholders using appropriate visualizations and metrics to make informed decisions based on the business questions asked.

#Dataset Information

Size: 440 customers Ã— 8 features
Features: Channel, Region, Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, Delicassen
Target: Identify customer segments based on spending patterns

#Key Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA, RobustScaler)
SciPy (Hierarchical Clustering)

#Major Findings

Customer Segmentation: Two distinct channels - Channel 1 (restaurants/hotels) focus on Fresh products, Channel 2 (retail stores) focus on Grocery/Milk/Detergents
Geographic Distribution: Region 3 dominates with 72% of customers, presenting expansion opportunities in Regions 1 & 2
PCA Results: 3 components explain 80% of variance, achieving 50% dimensionality reduction
Clustering: Both K-means and hierarchical clustering confirmed 3 optimal customer segments with clear business interpretations

#Business Impact
The analysis enables targeted marketing strategies, identifies geographic expansion opportunities, and provides data-driven customer segmentation for improved business decision-making.
